Fitch Ratings has revised down its US growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 due to the global trade war initiated by the new US administration, expecting reduced growth rates and delayed Federal Reserve rate cuts. This move comes as a response to the impact of higher US import tariffs, although fiscal easing in China and Germany may mitigate some effects ("World Growth Forecasts Cut Sharply as US Starts Global Trade War," **Fitch Ratings**, https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/global-economic-outlook-march-2025-18-03-2025).

On the global front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects balanced global growth risks, with a possibility of a soft landing and falling inflation rates in most regions ("World Economic Outlook Update," **IMF**, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/01/24/world-economic-outlook-update).
