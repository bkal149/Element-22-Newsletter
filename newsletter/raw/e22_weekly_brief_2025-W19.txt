===== Market & Macro Watch =====

**Summary:**
U.S. stocks rose amid positive labor market news while the S&P 500 saw its longest winning streak in 20 years.

**Full Brief:**
In the past week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were largely unchanged while the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced moderate weekly gains[^1^]. These developments followed a stronger-than-anticipated jobs report and comparatively subdued wage inflation[^1^].

**Summary:**
EU-US data privacy frameworks face scrutiny as regulatory enforcement strengthens and BigID reveals new data lifecycle management solution.

**Full Brief:**
The strengthening of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and an increase in several national privacy laws globally has led to more companies complying with privacy rules relating to fiduciary duty. These developments have resulted in the US Department of Commerce and BBB National Programs offering transatlantic data transfer compliance services, including dispute and complaint handling. Besides, after the DPF came into effect, the number of companies joining it increased to 2800 from 2400 when it was operating as Privacy Shield (**Infosecurity Magazine**, **https://infosecurity-magazine.com/**). Meanwhile, BigID, a data security, privacy, compliance and governance company, unveiled several features at the RSA Conference, such as labeling data within vector databases and launching a comprehensive Data Lifecycle Management solution (**SecurityWeek**, **https://securityweek.com/**). However, companies transferring data to China might have to reassess their GDPR compliance strategies following the Irish regulator's decision against TikTok (**Politico EU**, **https://politico.eu/**). Finally, differing privacy regulations globally might affect companies and industries differently, with those in Hong Kong and Singapore reported to struggle the most with abiding by all regulations.
