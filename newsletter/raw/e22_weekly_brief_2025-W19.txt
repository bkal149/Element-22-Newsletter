===== AI & Automation in Financial Services =====

Summary:
Adoption of AI systems continues to revolutionize financial services, helping automate several critical functions including compliance, regulatory reporting, and staff knowledge maintenance.

Full Brief:
AI continues to streamline multiple facets of financial institutions, ranging from operations to compliance. According to Jas Dillion of Finance IQ, dozens of use cases currently exist within large financial services organizations, all of which can experience significant improvements through AI automation. The returns on these investments are often realized within weeks, not years (**Finextra Research**, **https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28392/from-manual-to-machine-how-ai-is-streamlining-compliance-in-financial-services**). Examples of successful AI applications include Benefit Street Partners' use of AI in automating tax compliance processes, which led to an 80-percent reduction in costs and processing times, and AI-backed systems' potential in automating regulatory reporting data collection and analysis, therefore reducing errors and ensuring consistency. Furthermore, AI's deployment in financial institutions for real-time guidance and scenario-based training is enabling the continuous upskilling of staff, keeping them updated with evolving compliance requirements. In an example, JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management saw a 20-percent rise in sales between 2023 and 2024, attributable to GenAI-driven tools that allowed teams to focus on impactful client work (**FinTech Futures**, **https://www.fintechfutures.com/ai-in-fintech/fca-outlines-plans-for-live-ai-testing-service**).

Key Themes:
- AI applications within financial services companies are numerous and can yield returns within weeks of introduction (**Finextra Research**, **https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28392/from-manual-to-machine-how-ai-is-streamlining-compliance-in-financial-services**).
- AI's deployment in automating tax compliance processes and regulatory reporting tasks can lead to significant operational efficiencies and cost savings.
- AI platforms are increasingly being used in financial institutions for real-time upskilling of staff, keeping them updated with the evolving compliance requirements.

===== Data Privacy & Regulatory Compliance =====

Summary:
Scrutiny of international data transfers intensifies amidst ongoing developments in EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and regulatory actions against companies like TikTok.

Full Brief:
The recent weeks brought notable developments in international data privacy and regulatory compliance. After the DPF replaced EU-US Privacy Shield, more companies were reported joining the DPF, rising from 2400 to 2800 due to increasing enforcement of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and surge in national privacy laws globally (**Infosecurity Magazine**, **https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/trump-eu-us-data-privacy-framework/**). In a significant regulatory move, Ireland's privacy regulator levied a €530 million fine on TikTok for illegally transferring data to China, potentially prompting other companies with data transfers to China to reassess their compliance strategies (**politico.eu**, **https://www.politico.eu/article/tiktok-fine-eu-china-relations-ireland-data-privacy-regulation-surveillance/**). On the commercial front, data security and privacy company BigID rolled out multiple capabilities, including a complete Data Lifecycle Management solution at RSA Conference 2025 (**SecurityWeek**, **https://www.securityweek.com/rsa-conference-2025-announcements-summary-part-3/**). 

Key Themes:
- Enhanced privacy regulations globally are encouraging companies to join data privacy frameworks, such as the DPF, to maintain compliance and fulfil fiduciary duties to stakeholders (**Infosecurity Magazine**).
- High-profile regulatory actions like the recent TikTok fine prompt reevaluation of data handling practices for companies dealing with transborder data transfers and compliance with GDPR (**politico.eu**).

Director of Digital Strategy Transformation, Chenzira Allen, emphasizes that "equity is still a huge drive within our district" (**Anna Maria Blengino**, **https://technologymagazine.com/interviews/anna-maria-blengino**). Even industry giants such as PwC are seeing a slowdown, prompting layoffs underscoring industry trends, while others stress that digital transformation is about fostering a culture of continuous improvement rather than simply acquiring tools (**Anna Maria Blengino**, **Technology Magazine**).

===== Policy & Public Sector Data =====

Summary:
Increasing focus on robust data governance and infrastructure to support AI adoption in the public sector.

Full Brief:
Data governance and infrastructure are becoming increasingly critical as the public sector adopts AI technology. This underscores the importance of good quality data, especially in the context of generative AI applications. Poor data quality, if not addressed, could negatively impact AI initiatives, leading to the potential misallocation of resources and wastage of funding (Good Data is Key to Strong Artificial Intelligence Programs, [Firehouse](https://www.firehouse.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/news/55286127/good-data-is-key-to-strong-artificial-intelligence-programs-chief-information-officers-says)). The article from InterVision emphasizes the intersection of AI and data governance, highlighting the necessity to implement robust frameworks for data integrity, compliance, and ethical AI deployment. Particular attention is put on emerging regulations concerning data privacy and AI, adding layers of complexity for global deployments (AI and Data Governance: The New Competitive Advantage for IT Leaders, [GovTech](https://insider.govtech.com/california/sponsored/ai-and-data-governance-the-new-competitive-advantage-for-it-leaders)). Lastly, there's growing recognition that AI data centers are increasingly transforming into critical national infrastructures, signalling an urgent need to address associated security and regulatory pressures (AI Data Centers: Fortifying the Future, [Manufacturing.net](https://www.manufacturing.net/artificial-intelligence/blog/22940021/ai-data-centers-fortifying-the-future)).

With wealthtech being the final part of the financial service sector to undergo digitisation, collaborations with transformative technologies such as blockchain are now gaining significant attention. The trend highlights the potential of wealthtech to overhaul current systems into inclusive and transparent solutions.

Full Brief:
Recent developments indicate that wealthtech is now ready to move towards significant digital transformation, as noted by industry experts.
