**Summary:**
AI Accelerates Changes in Consulting & Advisory Amidst Global Workforce Shifts

**Full Brief:**
The consulting industry is experiencing notable changes fueled by digital transformation and AI technologies. **AI presents an opportunity for firms, but also threatens traditional operating models, leadership structures, and job roles** (Consultancy.uk).
