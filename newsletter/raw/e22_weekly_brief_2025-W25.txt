===== Policy & Public Sector Data =====

**Summary:**
The last week saw calls for the alignment of AI strategy with European data privacy regulations and infrastructural support, while in the US, a contested provision within a bill proposes a decade long halt on localized AI regulation.

**Full Brief:**
Recent developments indicate increasing demand for guidelines and strategic financial backing to support AI infrastructures, particularly in the public sector. Science Europe has expressed a need for AI usage in both grant applications and research output review, along with a focus on the environmental impacts of AI infrastructures (**Research Professional News**, **https://researchprofessionalnews.com**). Concurrently, national regulation of AI in the US has strong proponents looking to supersede state laws. For instance, OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, highlighted the importance of cohesive federal laws to avoid the industry having to conform to varied state-specific regulations (**GovTech**, **https://www.govtech.com**). However, this has raised concerns, as local governments might lose their ability to regulate AI effectively for their regions and would have to wait for federal legislation that aligns with their unique local realities. There is a growing belief that this provision could hamper innovation and application of AI at the local level.

Key Themes:
- Calls for guidelines and funding strategies to support the use of AI in research output and grant applications (**Research Professional News**, **https://researchprofessionalnews.com**).
- Increases in AI usage raises environmental concerns, prompting assessments of AI infrastructures' environmental impact (**Research Professional News**, **https://researchprofessionalnews.com**).
