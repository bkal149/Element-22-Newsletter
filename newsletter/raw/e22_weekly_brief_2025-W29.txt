===== Financial Services Transformation =====

**Summary:**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is powering a transformation in digital banking, driving personalized customer experiences and operational efficiency to propel the digitization of financial services.

**Full Brief:**
In 2024, the banking sector surpassed a key milestone when customers began demanding more personalized digital experiences. Banks responded by deploying artificial intelligence, fueling a shift from transactional to transformational services. Now, AI is fortifying banking with personalized, context-aware user experiences, which boost customer loyalty and risk displacement for banks clinging to generic digital models. AI has also played a pivotal role in increasing the adoption of digital-only banks, which house accounts for 40% of the UK population as of 2025. Despite the evident benefits, around 70% of digital transformation initiatives reportedly fail, largely due to adoption hurdles, unclear return on investment, or misaligned tools. ING Bank, however, has embraced a cloud-first approach, partnering with major hyperscalers rather than relying on traditional on-premise infrastructure. This strategy allows for agile adaptation to customer needs while also improving back-office efficiency via AI-driven workflow automation, including tasks like data entry, KYC, and AML processes. Moreover, AI can offer hyper-personalized customer experiences, analyze spending patterns, proactively offer tailored financial advice, and even initiate loan pre-approvals ("AI Is Rewriting the Rules of Digital Banking CX", **https://www.finextra.com**).

Key Themes:
- Banks are leveraging artificial intelligence to deliver hyper-personalized digital experiences, bolstering customer loyalty (Finextra).
- AI-driven enhancements underpin the mass migration to digital banking, even in markets with traditionally high branch usage (Finextra).
- Successful digital transformation initiatives are characterized by strategic hyperscaler partnerships, cloud-first strategies, and AI-driven workflow automation (Finextra).
