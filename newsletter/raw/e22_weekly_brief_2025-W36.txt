E22 Weekly Brief – September 01, 2025

===== Market & Macro Watch =====

**Summary:**
The S&P 500 hits a record high, leading the way for tech stocks despite recent obstacles related to inflation and political maneuvers to oust a federal reserve governor.

**Full Brief:**
The US stock market was a key topic this week. The S&P 500 index hit a record high level of 6,500 points, driven by market optimism and strong Q2 US economic data indicating greater than expected GDP growth of 3.3 percent (**The Wall Street Journal**, **https://www.wsj.com**). Tech stocks, in particular, have been beneficiaries of such gains, with Nvidia standing out, despite a post-earnings slip. The report from Nvidia was one of the most closely watched on Wall Street, primarily due to the company being a significant supplier of cutting-edge AI processors. The earnings report did not seem to stunt the stock's growth, and it tumbled after (**Seeking Alpha**, **https://seekingalpha.com**). On a political front, attempts by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook have drawn significant attention, although this has not hampered investment enthusiasm, with the possibility of an interest-rate cut in September still on the table(**Investopedia**, **https://www.investopedia.com**).

Key Themes:
- The S&P 500 hit an unprecedented high on the back of strong Q2 GDP data, underpinning market optimism (**The Wall Street Journal**, **https://www.wsj.com**).
- Tech stocks, specifically Nvidia, witnessed substantial movement despite a post-earnings slip (**Seeking Alpha**, **https://seekingalpha.com**).
- Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has yet to dampen investment optimism, with an interest rate cut still a possible future move (**Investopedia**, **https://www.investopedia.com**).
