===== Consulting & Advisory Trends =====

**Summary:**
Consulting is undergoing a significant shift with a renewed focus on specialisation, AI integration, and digital transformations influencing hiring practices and impacting consultant roles and revenues.

**Full Brief:**
The consulting sector is undergoing major changes. Firms are shifting their focus from general strategy to more specialized areas like technology consulting and are emphasizing experience and expertise. This shift in demand has been observed in the 'Big Three' consulting groups — McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group — which are seeing a slowdown in headcount numbers ("Culling of the herd", **Business Insider**, **https://businessinsider.com**). Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted by consulting firms, leading to increased productivity. However, implementing and scaling AI still poses challenges. Despite the underperformance of AI in real-time, domain-specific data access, the sector’s valuation is accelerating (48.7% CAGR to $890B by 2032) ("Underperformance in Generative AI Consulting Services", **AInvest**, **https://ainvest.com**). Digital transformations are seeing increased expenditures, projected to reach $3.4 trillion by 2026. However, the lack of integration between strategy and execution threatens to waste these investments ("Incubator hubs and the future of the consulting sector", **Consultancy.uk**, **https://consultancy.uk**). Therefore, businesses need to adopt a nuanced approach and navigate human and ethical dimensions of AI usage to ensure optimal outcomes.

Key Themes:
- Consulting firms are moving towards specialisation, with a preference for experience and expertise ("Culling of the herd", **Business Insider**, **https://businessinsider.com**).
- Despite automation leading to increased productivity, AI implementation in the consulting sector is facing scaling issues and a need for contextual, real-time data ("Underperformance in Generative AI Consulting Services", **AInvest**, **https://ainvest.com**).
- Investment in digital transformations is increasing, but a lack of integration between strategy and execution threatens to diminish the returns on these investments ("Incubator hubs and the future of the consulting sector", **Consultancy.uk**, **https://consultancy.uk**).
- New, collaborative working models, driven by AI and digital transformations, are becoming crucial to offset the risks of wasted investments and ensure rapid, sustainable disruption ("Incubator hubs and the future of the consulting sector", **Consultancy.uk**, **https://consultancy.uk**).

Recent developments highlight a significant increase in regulatory enforcement across data privacy and global privacy control (GPC) mandates.

**Full Brief:**
Regulatory agencies have heightened their scrutiny on businesses suspected to be violating Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals, urging them to ensure their systems are primed to detect and respect such signals. This action has emerged out of a multi-state privacy enforcement operation aimed at defaulters. Fintech companies are advised to implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) frameworks to manage money, identity, and risk across borders, responding to overlapping and evolving regulations and threats ("California, two other states to come down hard on GPC violators", [source](https://csoonline.com)). The California Legislature has also approved measures to increase online data privacy, requiring browser operators to facilitate users’ prevention of data sale and sharing across websites ("Federal Agency Updates: EEOC, OFCCP, and Department of Labor", [source](https://natlawreview.com)). Data governance and simultaneous prioritization of privacy, ethics and data quality are increasingly recognized as essential in tackling AI-related challenges ("FinTech Compliance in 2025: The Rules Are Changing — Are You Ready?", [source](https://finextra.com)).

===== Enterprise Data Management =====

**Summary:**
Emerging data management strategies prioritize real-time analytics, visibility-driven architectures, and the elimination of data silos for effective integration of AI systems.

**Full Brief:**
Companies are increasingly treating data as a strategic enterprise asset, leveraging it for growth, innovation, and resilience (**Business Insider**, **https://www.businessinsider.com**). Sydney Zoo, for instance, has begun streamlining its data architecture, using Microsoft Fabric to consolidate its databases into a unified analytics platform to bolster data availability and usability (**iTnews**, **https://www.itnews.com.au**). This move towards consolidation is echoed in the growing reliance on real-time, event-driven data movement, often underpinning AI systems requiring immediate access to data. As such, many firms are reorienting towards visibility-driven data architectures that provide end-to-end visibility and control over data infrastructure (**iTnews**, **https://www.itnews.com.au**). However, improving the data – its quality, standardization, and lineage – is only half the battle. Equally important is preparing existing data for ingestion into AI systems and ensuring seamless data flows across various departments for efficient decision-making and operations. The end goal is to transform chaotic data into impactful insights, accelerating innovation and ensuring enterprise resilience in the process.

Key Themes:
- Treating data as a strategic asset is a trend among enterprises looking to leverage it for growth and innovation (**Business Insider**, **https://www.businessinsider.com**).
- Consolidation of databases into unified platforms, such as Sydney Zoo's use of Microsoft Fabric, simplifies data architectures and enhances data availability (**iTnews**, **https://www.itnews.com.au**).
- More firms are moving towards real-time, event-driven data movement and visibility-driven architectures for immediate access and overall control of data infrastructure (**iTnews**, **https://www.itnews.com.au**).
- Ensuring seamless data flow across various departments is crucial for efficient decision-making and minimizing errors.
- Improving data quality and preparing it for AI models is essential for turning chaotic data into powerful insights.
