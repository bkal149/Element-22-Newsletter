===== AI & Automation in Financial Services =====

**Summary:**
AI integration within financial services has significantly contributed to increased operational efficiencies and customer satisfaction, with wider value restrained by quality data concerns and a lack of necessary infrastructure. 

**Full Brief:**
The utilization of AI within the financial services sector has spiked significantly, offering reduced operational costs and improved customer satisfaction by automating work processes, palming off mundane tasks, and freeing human employees for complex decisions (**Finextra Research**, [1](https://www.finextra.com)). Despite these advantages, there are impediments: flawed data and inadequate infrastructure have meant that some AI implementations lack the required impact. As noted, most setbacks in financial services AI deployments are linked to underestimation of the infrastructure work needed for delivering value back to the organization (**Finextra Research**, [2](https://www.finextra.com)). Therefore, AI should be treated strategically and not like a product that can be simply purchased and deployed. One significant stride has been made by Citigroup, with the integration of two AI platforms, Advisor Insights and AskWealth, to streamline workflows for its advisory teams (**FinTech Magazine**, [3](https://www.fintechmagazine.com)). While 75% of financial institutions are already leveraging AI, the importance of preparedness and alignment with an organization's infrastructural capabilities cannot be overstated.

Key Themes:
- Integration of AI has allowed financial institutions to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction by automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows (**Finextra Research**, [1](https://www.finextra.com)).
- Flawed data from legacy systems and insufficient infrastructure still pose significant setbacks to AI implementation within financial services (**Finextra Research**, [2](https://www.finextra.com)).
- Citi Wealth's launch of Advisor Insights and AskWealth platforms showcase the transformative impact of effective AI integration, underscoring the need for strategic planning, not just deploying technology products (**FinTech Magazine**, [3](https://www.fintechmagazine.com)).

===== Consulting & Advisory Trends =====

**Summary:**
As Consulting and Advisory firms face a drop in demand and an increase in AI implementation, the industry grapples with changes in human-advisor roles and business strategies amid potential layoffs.

**Full Brief:**
The Consulting sector is dealing with the advent of AI, which is being touted as a culprit for the industry's mediocre performance as clients seek their answers via AI solutions rather than traditional consultancies, particularly in financial services (Consultancy.uk[1]). This has become evident in the trend of businesses increasingly relying on direct investments from private equity for capital growth, rather than on consultancy services. Deloitte, for instance, has experienced a drastic fall in its consultancy growth rate and revenue which has led to staff cuts to handle the financial obstacles (HR Katha[2]). Therefore, establishing a balance between AI adoption and retaining the indispensability of human advisors has become crucial. AI can collapse the lower tier of repetitive tasks thereby disrupting the traditional apprenticeship model of knowledge transfer within consultancies. While that's efficient in terms of cost and service delivery, firms with a larger, experienced middle band will likely succeed in the AI era (Consultancy.uk[1]). Despite this, it's important to remember, as quoted, “AI will continue to evolve, but technology alone will not shape the path forward. What matters most is how businesses connect their long-term goals to the audiences that will deliver them." (Consultancy.uk[1])

Key Themes:
- Rise of AI in the consultancy sector is leading to a decrease in traditional consultancy demand (Consultancy.uk[1]).
- AI adoption is disrupting the traditional framework of knowledge transfer within consultancies (Consultancy.uk[1]).
- Despite layoffs, retaining a balance between AI and human inputs in strategy is crucial to a firm's success (HR Katha[2]).

===== Policy & Public Sector Data =====

**Summary:**
Public sector and government bodies globally are grappling with the rapid integration of AI technologies, necessitating a balance between innovation and governance, with a focus on creating robust AI policies and frameworks.

**Full Brief:**
The changing landscape of public-sector technology, propelled by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), presents both opportunities and challenges for government bodies and citizens alike, according to key insights from techUK's recent event (**PublicTechnology**, **[1]**).
