E22 Weekly Brief – October 13, 2025

===== Market & Macro Watch =====

**Summary:**
Suspense over U.S. tariffs drives fluctuating global market trends, with Chinese stocks suffering, while U.S. tech sector emerges as driving force behind current market rally.

**Full Brief:**
Over the weekend, global markets experienced anxiety over the threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods by the U.S. The S&P 500, NASDAQ and the Dow Jones experienced their worst day since April and May respectively, with the former closing sharply lower on Friday (**CNN**, **https://edition.cnn.com/business**). This anxiety was quelled to an extent when President Trump hinted at possibly retracting this threat. However, global markets including Asian stocks are yet to recover from this shock. 

On the brighter side, the U.S. market is currently in an overbought condition, driven by a surge of tech spending primarily connected to the AI revolution. S&P 500 and NASDAQ hit record closes, sparked by AMD's OpenAI deal, highlighting the role of the tech sector in pushing market trends (**Seeking Alpha**, **https://seekingalpha.com/article/4330356-u-s-economy-storm-coming**). 

Yet, beneath these positives, concerns exist. A falling dollar and a record gold price signal deep-seated concerns about factors such as sovereign debt levels throughout the world and a faltering U.S. job market. These concerns point to a potentially looming storm for the U.S. economy.

Key Themes:
- Threat of increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods instigates anxiety and volatility in global markets (**CNN**, **https://edition.cnn.com/business**).
- The U.S. tech sector emerges as a strong driver for the current market rally with OpenAI deal’s impact on AMD stocks being a prime example (**Seeking Alpha**, **https://seekingalpha.com/article/4330356-u-s-economy-storm-coming**).
- Underlying concerns persist despite positive market conditions, with signals such as a falling dollar and a record gold price forecasting potential turbulence in the U.S. economy (**Seeking Alpha**, **https://seekingalpha.com/article/4330356-u-s-economy-storm-coming**).
